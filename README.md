* After doing this, confirm that you have installed virtualenv globally as well. If not, run this:
    ```bash
        $ pip install virtualenv
    ```

    ```bash
        $ git clone https://github.com/gitgik/django-rest-api.git
    ```

            $ source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    3. Install the dependencies needed to run the app:
        ```bash
            $ pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

    ```bash
        $ python manage.py runserver
    ```
